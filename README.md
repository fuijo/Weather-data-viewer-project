Data Visualization Track Requirements 
Data and Delivery 
The dataset contains at least 100 unique records. 

A database is used to house the data (SQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.). 

The GitHub repo has a README.md that includes the following: 

An overview of the project and its purpose

Instructions on how to use and interact with the project

At least one paragraph summarizing efforts for ethical considerations made in the project

References for the data source(s)

References for any code used that is not your own

Visualizations 
A minimum of three unique views present the data. 
The visualizations are presented in a clear, digestible manner. 
The data story is easy to interpret for users of all levels. 
Usability 
The script, notebook, or webpage created to showcase data visualizations runs without error. 

A Python or JavaScript library not shown in class is used in the project. 

The project includes some level of user-driven interaction, conforming to one of the following designs: 

HTML menus, dropdowns, and/or textboxes to display JavaScript-powered visualizations

Flask backend with interactive API routes that serve back Python or JavaScript created plots

Visualizations created from user-selected filtered data

Data Engineering Track Requirements 
Database Design 
The project uses ETL workflows to ingest data into the database. 

The original dataset(s) are transformed prior to storing it in the database. 

A database is used to house the data (SQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.). 

The database has at least two tables (SQL) or collections (NoSQL). 

The project documents the choice of the database used and why. 

The project includes documentation of the ETL workflow with diagrams or ERD. 

Data and Delivery 
The database contains at least 100 unique records.

The project uses one additional library not covered in class related to data engineering. 

The project includes a method for reading data from the database and displaying it for future use, such as: 

Pandas DataFrame

Flask API with JSON output

The GitHub repo has a README.md that includes the following: 

An overview of the project and its purpose

Instructions on how to use and interact with the project
