# Weather_data_viewer
# Project Overview: 
The Weather Data Project is an interactive web-based application designed to visualize and analyze weather data across global cities. It integrates data-driven features, map-based visualizations, and an intuitive user interface to provide insights into geographic weather patterns.

# Instructions
Data Visualization Track Requirements 
Data and Delivery 
The dataset contains at least 100 unique records. 

A database is used to house the data (SQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.). 

The GitHub repo has a README.md that includes the following: 

An overview of the project and its purpose

Instructions on how to use and interact with the project

At least one paragraph summarizing efforts for ethical considerations made in the project

References for the data source(s)

References for any code used that is not your own

Visualizations 
A minimum of three unique views present the data. 
The visualizations are presented in a clear, digestible manner. 
The data story is easy to interpret for users of all levels. 
Usability 
The script, notebook, or webpage created to showcase data visualizations runs without error. 

A Python or JavaScript library not shown in class is used in the project. 

The project includes some level of user-driven interaction, conforming to one of the following designs: 

HTML menus, dropdowns, and/or textboxes to display JavaScript-powered visualizations

Flask backend with interactive API routes that serve back Python or JavaScript created plots

Visualizations created from user-selected filtered data

Data Engineering Track Requirements 
Database Design 
The project uses ETL workflows to ingest data into the database. 

The original dataset(s) are transformed prior to storing it in the database. 

A database is used to house the data (SQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.). 

The database has at least two tables (SQL) or collections (NoSQL). 

The project documents the choice of the database used and why. 

The project includes documentation of the ETL workflow with diagrams or ERD. 

Data and Delivery 
The database contains at least 100 unique records.

The project uses one additional library not covered in class related to data engineering. 

The project includes a method for reading data from the database and displaying it for future use, such as: 

Pandas DataFrame

Flask API with JSON output

The GitHub repo has a README.md that includes the following: 

An overview of the project and its purpose

Instructions on how to use and interact with the project

At least one paragraph summarizing efforts for ethical considerations made in the project

References for the data source(s)

References for any code used that is not your own

# **Insights and Findings:**

- **Temperature Trends:** The app allows users to visually identify temperature patterns using color-coded markers (e.g., orange for warmer cities and green for cooler ones).

- **Global Comparisons:** Users can explore weather data from both hemispheres, analyzing variations in temperature and other metrics across different regions.

- **Ease of Navigation:** The app incorporates search and filtering options that facilitate efficient exploration of large datasets.

**Technical Stack:**

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS (custom styles), and JavaScript.

- **Libraries and Tools:** Leaflet.js, D3.js, MarkerCluster, and Leaflet Geocoder.

- **Data Handling:** CSV files are used to manage weather data.

**Conclusion:** The Weather Data Project showcases a strong integration of data visualization and geographic mapping technologies. It serves as a valuable tool for analyzing global weather patterns, presenting data in a clear and accessible format. The interactive features, combined with detailed weather insights, make it an excellent resource for both educational and analytical purposes.
